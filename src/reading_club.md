# Reading Club

Some of us at Lambda have formed a reading club, where we propose, vote, select, read, and discuss books, papers, posts, videos, or any material we feel is interesting or advances our skills as developers and humans.
To participate in the reading club, take a look at the following document:

Here we collect suggestions and maintain a record of what we have read.

The group gathers on Tuesdays at 18:00. Ping someone to get added to the calendar event.

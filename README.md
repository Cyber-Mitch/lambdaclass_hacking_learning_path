# Getting started

Two-step authentication is mandatory for every login of the company accounts (e.g. Slack, mail, GitHub).

Also, the company's GitHub repositories are accessed via SSH:

https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh

# GitHub

Progress in any project must be pushed every day. This must be done within a branch of the master repository and a Pull Request (PR) must be opened for reviewing the code, previous to merging the branch to master. Never push to master directly, and the person who opens a PR never merges.


# Working method

There is a weekly call with every member of the team to set the most important goals of the week, as well as a daily call to focus on the problems of the daily tasks.

When working on projects, the specific tasks to tackle are written in clickup.
